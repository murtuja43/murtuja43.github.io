<h1>This repository is used as my daily learning and consistency log.</h1>
<h2>Daily Log & To Do</h2>


<p>🟢 Restarted C++ (Algorithms)</p>
<p>🟢 Made videos on how to connect VS Code with GitHub</p>
<p>🟢 Did debugging on previous code</p>
<p>🟢 Working on an Excel Project</p>
<p>🟢 Completed an Excel Course on Udemy</p>
<p>🟢 Solved theoretical mechanics problems</p>
<p>🟢 Learned C++ (Functions)</p>
<p>🟢 Learned some philosophy today. Sometimes people just don't think
so much about things and are happy. But sometimes people think about thinks like- the meaning of life, who am i, etc and feel unhappy. Still choosing 1 which gives you relaxation is the best.</p>
<p>🟢 Took ideas of machine learning, what is it, how it works, why we need it, etc</p>
<p>🟢 Learned c++ functions more</p>
<p>🟢 Started learning AI Engineering</p>
<p>🟢 I'm using "https://roadmap.sh/ai-engineer" this to record my ai engineering progress</p>
<p>🟢 Just read an article "https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/artificial-intelligence-tutorial/how-to-become-an-ai-engineer". In this article I learned what we need to learn to become an AI Engineer.</p>
<p>🟢 Solved some PDE (partial differentail equation) problems.</p>
<p>🟢 Participated in a chess tournament (ranked 7th place) and also practiced some ideas of c++</p>
<p>🟢 Just read an article "https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/How-to-become-an-artificial-intelligence-engineer". In this article I learned what we need to learn to become an AI Engineer.</p>
<p>🟢 Started using jupyter notebook and vscode together. </p>
<p>🟢 Delivered a presentation on Philosophy (What is philosophy, why it is needed, how this is connected with other specialities and etc were the topics I explained.)</p>
<p>🟢 Studied an ai engineering article</p>
<p>🟢 Studied an ai engineering article (a new one)</p>
<p>🟢 Practiced c++ functions</p>
