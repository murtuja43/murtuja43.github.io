<h1>This repository is used as my daily learning and consistency log.</h1>
<h2>Daily Log & To Do</h2>


<p>🟢 Restarted C++ (Algorithms)</p>
<p>🟢 Made videos on how to connect VS Code with GitHub</p>
<p>🟢 Did debugging on previous code</p>
<p>🟢 Working on an Excel Project</p>
<p>🟢 Completed an Excel Course on Udemy</p>
<p>🟢 Solved theoretical mechanics problems</p>
<p>🟢 Learned C++ (Functions)</p>
<p>🟢 Learned some philosophy today. Sometimes people just don't think
so much about things and are happy. But sometimes people think about thinks like- the meaning of life, who am i, etc and feel unhappy. Still choosing 1 which gives you relaxation is the best.</p>
<p>🟢 Took ideas of machine learning, what is it, how it works, why we need it, etc</p>
<p>🟢 Learned c++ functions more</p>
<p>🟢 Started learning AI Engineering</p>
<p>🟢 AI engineer roadmap https://roadmap.sh/ai-engineer</p>
<p>🟢 I'm using "https://roadmap.sh/ai-engineer" this to record my ai engineering progress</p>
<p>🟢 Just read an article "https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/artificial-intelligence-tutorial/how-to-become-an-ai-engineer". In this article I learned what we need to learn to become an AI Engineer.</p>
<p>🟢 Solved some PDE (partial differentail equation) problems.</p>
<p>🟢 Participated in a chess tournament (ranked 7th place) and also practiced some ideas of c++</p>
<p>🟢 Just read an article "https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/How-to-become-an-artificial-intelligence-engineer". In this article I learned what we need to learn to become an AI Engineer.</p>
<p>🟢 Started using jupyter notebook and vscode together. </p>
<p>🟢 Delivered a presentation on Philosophy (What is philosophy, why it is needed, how this is connected with other specialities and etc were the topics I explained.)</p>
<p>🟢 Studied an ai engineering article</p>
<p>🟢 Studied an ai engineering article (a new one)</p>
<p>🟢 Practiced c++ functions</p>
<p>🟢 Started Learning Ai Engineering. Currently learning from https://app.datacamp.com/learn/?utm_source=customerio&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=240719_1-welcome_2-mix_3-all_4-na_5-na_6-na_7-le_8-emal-ci_9-na_10-bau_11-email&utm_content=auto. (Update: it has 13 courses to complete the whole course, but only the first one is free. that's why not learning from here anymore)
<p>Read an article on ai engineer "https://roadmap.sh/ai/guide/what-is-ai-engineering-1770816097584" </p>
<p>Took idea of how a ai engineer is hired from here https://resources.workable.com/ai-engineer-job-description</p>
<p>🟢 Learned AI in Product Development: Netflix, BMW, and PepsiCo from https://www.virtasant.com/ai-today/ai-in-product-development-netflix-bmw#:~:text=AI%20can%20help%20make%20product,and%20gain%20a%20competitive%20edge.</p> </p>

<p>🟢 Learned ai engineer vs ml engineer from https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-machine-learning-engineer & https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-does-an-ai-engineer-do</p>

<p>🟢 Learned about AGI from https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/artificial-general-intelligence/. Just read an article on ai vs agi from https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/05/20/the-crucial-difference-between-ai-and-agi/ but remember agi (artificial general intellegence) is still a long way to go. it's not invented yet.</p>
